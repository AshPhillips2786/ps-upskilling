# PS-Upskilling

This is the upskilling gamification/tracker for Project Snowden. It consists of a Jinja-fied HTML template, some static assets, a flat-file database, and a Python script that transforms all of these into a static site showing the current status of the Project Snowden team member's directed upskilling progress. The intention is that this system can be used for the lifetime of the project.
